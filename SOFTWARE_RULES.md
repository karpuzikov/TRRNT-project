# Software Rules

These rules apply to all current and future software maintained under the `karpuzikov` GitHub account. Repository-specific rules may add stricter requirements, but must not weaken these baseline requirements.

## Highest-priority conversational trigger: `this chat is done`

**STOP AND HAND OFF, NEVER JUST CLOSE THE CHAT.** When the user says exactly `this chat is done` in a software-development conversation, perform the complete GitHub closeout described below **before replying**. This trigger requires action, not merely a polite acknowledgment, and takes precedence over a generic brief-answer/stop response.

Required, in order: (1) audit the conversation for pending changes, rules, bugs, version/status, results and next steps; (2) write missing details into the project's canonical `CONTINUITY.md` and relevant rules; (3) fetch the files back from GitHub and verify the commit and content; (4) reply with a genuinely concise **TLDR**, a real commit or updated file link, and a **ready-to-copy continuation prompt** identifying the project and the GitHub rules/continuity files to read first. If the GitHub write or verification fails, **explicitly state that the handoff is incomplete** and give a recovery prompt; never say only "chat closed", "this chat is closed", or falsely claim the handoff succeeded.

This is a global requirement for every `karpuzikov` software repository and every new conversation, **even when the phrase arrives after an unfinished implementation or a prior attempt already reported completion**. An unfinished build stays `Under construction ⚠️`; do not launch or publish unrelated code in lieu of handoff. If the documentation is already complete, still verify it and provide the continuation prompt.

## Universal compliance gate - release blocking

This section is a meta-rule over **every rule in this file, every project-specific rule, and every permanent software rule the user adds later**.

Unless a rule is explicitly labeled as optional/recommendation, it is a **release-blocking invariant**, not a suggestion.

### GitHub-wide rule synchronization

- The canonical global rule source is `karpuzikov/userscripts/SOFTWARE_RULES.md`.
- Every software repository maintained under the `karpuzikov` GitHub account must contain an exact current mirror of this file at its repository root.
- Whenever the canonical global rules change, synchronize the full file to every existing software repository before further software work is considered ready.
- Any newly created or newly adopted software repository must receive the current global rule file before its first modification or release.
- A stale, shortened, summarized, or selectively copied rule file is a compliance failure. Project-specific rules may add stricter requirements in separate rule files, but may not replace or weaken the complete global baseline.
- Before software work begins in any repository, verify that its mirrored `SOFTWARE_RULES.md` matches the canonical file exactly.

### Canonical mandatory UI/UX test gate

- The file `UI_UX_RULES.md` is mandatory and must be mirrored **verbatim** from `karpuzikov/userscripts` to every `karpuzikov` software repository, alongside this `SOFTWARE_RULES.md`. Read both before editing a user-facing interface.
- **Before implementation**, document the unique purpose, action, persistent side effects, keyboard and pointer interactions, visual states, dimensions and icons for **every control** in the affected workflow. Reuse a shared design system. Do not create duplicate actions, inconsistent buttons, needless padding, missing icons or broken hover states.
- **After implementation**, launch the real application on the target GUI platform, inspect **actual screenshots**, test hover, click, selection, keyboard, resize, scroll, dialogs, cancellation and errors, and compare references side by side. Fix discrepancies before declaring completion.
- Unit tests, syntax checking, fake widgets and static inspection **do not count as real visual/interaction acceptance**. Unavailable target runtime, or any unexecuted required test, must be recorded as **NOT RUN** in `CONTINUITY.md` and block any completed/stable claim; status remains `Under construction ⚠️`.
- For new Python GUIs default to PySide6. **Never use Tkinter.**

### Mandatory preflight

Before creating, modifying, building, publishing, or handing off any software:

1. Load/review the latest global rules in this file.
2. Load/review the target project's own rules.
3. Load/review the target software's mandatory `CONTINUITY.md` handoff file.
4. Apply the newest explicit user instruction when it conflicts with an older rule.
5. For any user-facing UI work, re-check the relevant current UXDT guideline pages before implementation.
6. Identify all cross-cutting rules affected by the change, not only the feature explicitly requested.

### TLDR response invariant

- `TLDR` is a content contract, not a decorative label. If a user-visible software-work reply begins with `TLDR`, or the user has requested TLDR responses by default, the answer itself must actually be concise.
- Never write `TLDR` and then follow it with a long design document, exhaustive explanation, many sections, or a large list unless the user explicitly asked for detailed material in addition to the TLDR.
- Default software replies should contain only the result/current status, the essential change(s), the immediate next action or test request, and a relevant download/repository link when applicable.
- Before sending a reply, perform a final consistency check: if the message says `TLDR` but the body is not genuinely TLDR, shorten the body before sending it.
- If the user explicitly asks for a detailed explanation, either omit the `TLDR` label or give a genuinely short TLDR first and then the requested detail. Do not use `TLDR` as the first word for a response whose main body is long by default.

### Mandatory per-software continuity file

Every current and future GitHub software project maintained under the `karpuzikov` account must have an up-to-date `CONTINUITY.md` file that allows a new ChatGPT conversation or developer to continue the work without relying on chat memory.

- For a repository containing one software product, keep `CONTINUITY.md` at the repository root.
- For a monorepo containing multiple independent software products, keep one `CONTINUITY.md` in each software project's own root directory. A repository-level file may exist additionally, but it does not replace the per-product file.
- Create the file before the first substantive code change for new software. For existing software that does not yet have one, creating/updating it is mandatory at the next modification before that modification is considered complete.
- Update `CONTINUITY.md` in the same development checkpoint whenever versions, architecture, feature behavior, rules, dependencies, paths, build/release flow, known bugs, test status, failed approaches, current implementation state, or next steps change.
- The file is an authoritative handoff document, not a changelog-only summary. It must contain enough concrete detail to resume implementation without reading the prior chat.
- At minimum record: product purpose; current version and development status; canonical source paths; active branches; architecture; dependencies; persistent-data locations; complete important feature/behavior contracts; UI/UX requirements; build/package/release procedure; tests and validation gates; known issues; failed/rejected approaches that must not be repeated; current work-in-progress state; exact next steps; and unresolved decisions/risks.
- Explicitly record compatibility/parity requirements when one implementation replaces or rewrites another. Missing functionality must be listed as a blocker, not silently omitted.
- Record relevant user-requested invariants and project-specific rules in operational terms so a future conversation can implement them correctly.
- Do not put passwords, access tokens, private keys, session cookies, authentication secrets, or other sensitive credentials in `CONTINUITY.md`.
- Before starting work, read the file. Before ending or handing off a development checkpoint, update it.
- A missing or materially stale `CONTINUITY.md` is a release-blocking compliance failure.
- This requirement applies to every existing and future software project under `karpuzikov`; no project is grandfathered.

### Chat handoff command - `this chat is done`

The exact user phrase `this chat is done` is a global software handoff command for every current and future software project maintained under the `karpuzikov` GitHub account.

When the user sends this phrase:

- Treat the current development conversation as ending.
- Before replying, audit the current chat for any software-relevant decisions, requirements, bug findings, rejected approaches, implementation details, version/status changes, test results, unresolved issues, or next steps that have not yet been saved to the appropriate GitHub documentation.
- Save any missing information to GitHub immediately, updating the product's `CONTINUITY.md` and any other authoritative project/global documentation that must stay synchronized.
- Do not rely on chat memory as the handoff mechanism. GitHub documentation must be sufficient for a fresh conversation to continue correctly.
- If the current code/documentation checkpoint is incomplete or inconsistent, fix the documentation before considering the handoff complete.
- Read back the GitHub files after writing; verify the accepted commit and that the checkpoint contains all required details. Never claim the handoff completed on an unverified or failed write.
- After the verified GitHub handoff, reply with a concise TLDR, commit/file link, and a ready-to-copy continuation message for the next chat. Do not replace these with "chat closed" or other acknowledgments.
- The continuation message must state project/repository, exact version and status, outstanding task/bug, and instruct the next chat to read the latest `SOFTWARE_RULES.md`, project rules, and product `CONTINUITY.md` from GitHub first.
- If any GitHub update or verification cannot be completed, mark **HANDOFF INCOMPLETE** and explain what could not be saved or verified rather than falsely closing.
- This command does not by itself mark software as tested/stable or remove `Under construction ⚠️`; normal testing/status rules still apply.

### Mandatory whole-product compliance audit

Before an update is considered ready:

- Audit the **entire affected product/UI**, including pre-existing controls and behavior touched by the same workflow.
- Do not limit compliance checks to newly added lines, newly added controls, or the specific feature requested.
- Existing software is **not grandfathered**. If an existing violation is visible while updating the product, fix it in the same update.
- A violation of any mandatory rule is a **bug and release blocker**.
- Do not publish/build/hand off the update until discovered blocking violations are corrected.
- If a mandatory rule cannot literally be implemented because of platform limitations, implement the closest platform-native equivalent and explicitly document the limitation instead of silently skipping the rule.

### Enforcement by construction

Wherever practical, mandatory cross-cutting rules must be implemented through shared components/helpers so individual screens/features cannot silently omit them.

Examples include:

- filesystem-path display/open behavior;
- theme, typography, spacing and status/progress patterns;
- dependency/bootstrap behavior;
- persistent-data location;
- retry/network policy;
- update/version behavior;
- destructive-action confirmation/recovery;
- accessibility and keyboard/focus behavior.

When practical, add regression/static checks that fail validation when a mandatory invariant is bypassed.

### Final release gate

Immediately before publishing or handing off software, explicitly verify:

- all applicable global rules pass;
- all applicable project rules pass;
- all applicable UXDT requirements pass;
- existing affected UI/behavior was audited, not only new work;
- no known mandatory-rule violation remains.

If any item fails, the software remains **Under construction ⚠️** and the release/update is not considered complete.

## UXDT baseline - mandatory for all software

The complete UXDT Guidelines tree at `https://www.uxdt.nic.in/guidelines/` is the mandatory UI/UX reference baseline for all current and future software maintained under the `karpuzikov` GitHub account, including every nested chapter and subpage. This is not limited to the "Understanding UX" section.

When exact or current guidance matters, re-check the relevant UXDT subpage before implementation instead of relying on memory or a partial summary. For every user-facing update, this re-check is mandatory before implementation and the applicable UXDT items must be re-audited before release. Apply the guidance in a platform-appropriate way to desktop GUIs, browser userscripts, web apps, plugins, installers, console tools, and other user-facing software. Do not force web-only patterns onto native applications when the native platform has a clearer accessible equivalent.

Existing software is not considered UX-finished merely because it predates this rule. Any existing user-facing interface that is updated must be audited against the relevant UXDT guidance and improved where applicable before the update is considered ready for testing.

### Mandatory UX outcomes

- **User-centered task flow:** Organize the interface around the user's actual task, minimize unnecessary steps, surface primary actions clearly, and keep secondary/advanced actions subordinate.
- **Learnability and clarity:** A first-time user must understand the purpose, current state, available actions, and expected result without prior chat context or external documentation.
- **Consistency:** Reuse established terminology, layout, control behavior, spacing, typography, iconography, status patterns, and interaction conventions across related tools.
- **Accessibility:** Support keyboard operation where the platform permits it, logical focus order, visible focus states, descriptive control names, sufficient contrast, scalable/readable text, and assistive-technology semantics where available.
- **Color independence:** Never rely on color alone to communicate state, success, warning, error, selection, or required action. Pair color with text, shape, iconography, or another perceivable cue.
- **Readable visual hierarchy:** Use clear headings, grouping, alignment, whitespace, and typographic hierarchy. Avoid visual clutter and decorative elements that compete with the primary task.
- **Forms and data entry:** Use explicit labels, sensible defaults, constrained inputs where useful, validation close to the affected field, and actionable error messages that explain how to correct the problem.
- **Error prevention and recovery:** Prevent destructive or invalid actions when practical, confirm genuinely destructive operations, explain consequences before execution, preserve user work where possible, and provide recovery/undo when feasible.
- **System feedback:** Every interaction must provide timely visible feedback. Long-running operations must show the current stage and activity/progress instead of appearing frozen.
- **User control:** Do not unexpectedly navigate, submit, delete, overwrite, move, or modify data. Make state-changing actions explicit and reversible where practical.
- **Responsive/adaptive layout:** Web and resizable interfaces must remain usable across supported viewport/window sizes, text scaling, and zoom. Avoid clipped controls, hidden critical actions, or layouts that require unnecessary horizontal scrolling.
- **Touch and pointer usability:** Where touch use is plausible, controls must have adequate target size and spacing. Pointer-only interactions must not be the sole path to essential functionality when keyboard or native alternatives are available.
- **Performance:** Keep startup, interaction, rendering, and long-running workflows efficient; avoid blocking the UI thread when practical; lazy-load or defer non-critical work where appropriate; and provide progress for unavoidable waits.
- **Content and language:** Use concise, precise, user-facing language. Prefer descriptive action labels over generic labels such as `OK`, `Apply`, or `Process` when the action is not otherwise obvious.
- **Navigation and orientation:** Users must always be able to understand where they are, what scope they are operating on, and how to return or cancel without losing work.
- **Testing and iteration:** Test the interface against the relevant UXDT usability, accessibility, responsive, performance, and implementation checklists. For web UI, include keyboard-only use and zoom/reflow checks; for native UI, test the closest platform equivalents.
- **Design-system discipline:** Reuse shared components/patterns within a project family instead of creating one-off UI behavior. New controls should match the established system unless a deliberate improvement is being rolled out consistently.
- **No false compliance claims:** Do not label software "UXDT compliant" solely because this rule exists. Compliance/readiness must be based on an actual implementation review of the relevant interface.
- **Release blocking:** Applicable UXDT findings are treated exactly like other mandatory software-rule findings. A known applicable usability/accessibility/learnability/efficiency/navigation/forms/visual-hierarchy/performance/design-system violation blocks completion until corrected or a genuine platform limitation is explicitly documented.
- **Full-tree review:** Do not treat the linked Understanding UX page as the whole standard. The applicable review spans the complete current UXDT guideline tree, including design process, navigation/information architecture, task orientation, forms/data entry, writing/content quality, inclusivity/accessibility, technical considerations, performance, design-system guidance, implementation, UX audits, evaluation/feedback and the UX compliance checklist.

## Unified software design

### Filesystem path controls - mandatory global invariant

Whenever **any filesystem path** is displayed anywhere in any current or future software, place a folder/open-location control **immediately before the path**.

This applies globally to every UI surface, including:

- path input fields and selected-folder fields;
- read-only path labels;
- release/file details;
- maps/graphs and detail panes;
- settings;
- logs and result views;
- errors/warnings;
- dependency/status views;
- dialogs;
- tooltips/popovers where a path is presented as an actionable location;
- any future UI that exposes a local filesystem path.

Required behavior:

- If the path is a directory, the control opens that exact directory in the platform file manager.
- If the path is a file, the control opens the containing directory with that exact file selected when the platform supports it; otherwise open the containing directory.
- The open-location control must be visually adjacent to and clearly associated with the path.
- Do not render a filesystem path as plain UI text through a one-off control when a shared path-display component/helper can be used.
- Existing path displays are not grandfathered. Any software update must audit the affected product for path displays and add the control wherever it is missing.
- Missing path controls are a release-blocking compliance failure.

### Dark-theme UI

- All new and updated GUI software uses a dark theme by default unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
- Related GUI tools must reuse the established visual language of the closest existing tool, including palette, font family, font sizes, spacing, control sizing, progress/status presentation, and activity/log styling.
- When a specific existing tool is named as the UI reference, match its typography hierarchy as well as its colors. For the Duplicate Edition Analyzer family, use Segoe UI 9 for normal text, Segoe UI 10 bold for section headings, Segoe UI 15 bold for major headings, and Cascadia Mono 9 for activity/log text where monospaced text is appropriate.

### Self-explanatory UI

A first-time user must be able to understand every core UI element without prior chat context, a README, or remembering how the tool works.

- Avoid ambiguous labels such as `Exclude X`, `Filter`, `Process`, or `Apply` when the effect is not obvious.
- Inputs must state what the user should select and what that input is used for.
- Checkboxes/options must state exactly what changes when they are enabled.
- Buttons must describe the action they trigger.
- If analysis and file modification are separate stages, the UI must say so.
- Move/delete/replace operations must identify what will happen and where affected files go.
- Progress/status text must identify the current operation instead of leaving the UI apparently frozen.
- Core behavior must be explained inline where needed, using concise technical wording rather than patronizing reassurance.
- UI wording and behavior should remain consistent across related tools.

## Self-explanatory UI and visible progress

- A first-time user must understand every control without needing prior chat context or a README.
- Prefer short, affirmative labels that describe the effect directly. Avoid inverted or ambiguous controls such as "Exclude ..." when a clearer "Save ..." / "Keep ..." label exists.
- Do not solve clarity problems by filling the window with explanatory paragraphs. Keep the main UI concise; use clear labels, layout, and tooltips for secondary detail.
- Every long-running operation must visibly prove that it is active: show the current stage, a progress bar where measurable, processed/total counts, elapsed time, and a compact activity/log area when multiple stages are involved.
- Software must not appear frozen while doing background work.

## MusicBrainz request reliability

This is a mandatory global rule for **all current and future MusicBrainz-related software**, including userscripts, desktop tools, importers, matchers, lookup utilities, and any other software that sends requests to MusicBrainz.

- Any MusicBrainz HTTP request that receives **HTTP 503 Service Unavailable** must automatically retry.
- 503 retries are **unlimited**. Do not stop after a fixed attempt count.
- Continue retrying until MusicBrainz returns a response whose status is not 503.
- Respect the `Retry-After` response header when MusicBrainz provides one.
- When `Retry-After` is absent or invalid, wait at least 5 seconds before retrying to avoid hammering the service.
- Once a non-503 response is received, resume the software's normal handling for that status. Do not turn permanent 404/400/etc. responses into infinite retry loops.
- A timeout, network failure, 429, or other status may use its own existing policy, but **503 must never fail permanently because an attempt limit was reached**.
- This rule applies to every MusicBrainz request path, not only primary API calls. It includes Web Service requests, same-origin MusicBrainz helper endpoints, edit-preview/data requests, URL lookups, artist/recording/release lookups, and MusicBrainz requests made through `fetch`, XHR, `GM_xmlhttpRequest`, or equivalent clients.
- New MusicBrainz-related code must use a shared 503-retry helper or equivalent centralized mechanism wherever practical so individual features cannot silently omit this behavior.

## Userscript distribution and update integrity

This is a blocking rule. A userscript update is not considered published until every check below passes.

### Hard post-update delivery gate

This gate exists specifically to prevent a same-version Tampermonkey **Reinstall** screen and to enforce the user's rule: **never provide commit links**.

- Never give the user a GitHub commit link.
- Never give the user a GitHub commit-page URL as a substitute for an installer/update link.
- After publishing or modifying an already-installed userscript, do not provide any installer-capable URL unless it is explicitly safe at that moment.
- A direct userscript installer URL is allowed only when one of these is true:
  1. the user explicitly wants a first install and the script is not installed; or
  2. the user's installed version is explicitly known to be lower than the verified target version.
- If the installed version is equal to the target, unknown, may already have auto-updated, or cannot be re-verified, do not provide a direct `.user.js` installer URL. Tell the user to use Tampermonkey's native **Check for userscript updates** instead.
- Never use a GitHub `blob/.../*.user.js` page as a supposedly safe fallback. Tampermonkey can intercept userscript file pages and open them as raw installers.
- If a safe non-installer repository reference is genuinely useful, use a normal repository or directory page, never a commit page.
- Never use wording such as `Download / Install`, `Update here`, or `Install latest` when the user's installed version may already equal the target.
- This gate overrides any earlier preference to provide a link after every update when providing such a link could trigger **Reinstall** or would require a commit link.
- Before sending every post-update reply, perform this exact final check:
  - Does the reply contain a GitHub commit link? If yes, remove it.
  - Does the reply contain a direct `.user.js` installer or another installer-capable userscript URL?
  - If yes, is the installed version explicitly known **right now** to be lower than the target, or is this explicitly a first install?
  - If not, remove that installer link and tell the user to use Tampermonkey's native update check.
- Failure of this gate is a production-stop condition. Do not continue unrelated publishing until the delivery mistake is corrected.

### Tampermonkey-native updates only

- Userscripts must rely on Tampermonkey's native update mechanism through `@updateURL` and `@downloadURL`.
- Do not add custom in-page update checkers, update popups, update banners, version polling, GitHub API update checks, or custom Update buttons unless the user explicitly requests that exact behavior.
- Do not maintain a separate hard-coded current-version constant for update detection.
- When an installed userscript needs updating, increase `@version` and let Tampermonkey handle update detection and installation.

### Tampermonkey UPDATE vs REINSTALL

- A direct `.user.js` install URL is **not** an update button. If its `@version` equals the installed version, Tampermonkey correctly shows **Reinstall**, which can reset script settings.
- Never label, present, or describe a direct `.user.js` link as **UPDATE** unless the user's installed version is explicitly known and is lower than the linked script's verified `@version`.
- If the installed version is equal to the target version, never tell the user to open the direct userscript URL. State that the current version is already installed.
- If the installed version is unknown, call the direct link **Install latest** only; do not call it **Update**.
- For already-installed scripts, the normal update path is Tampermonkey's native update mechanism using an increased `@version` plus `@updateURL`/`@downloadURL`.
- Never manufacture a version bump solely to turn a same-version Reinstall screen into an Update screen.

### Distribution URLs

- Never use query-string cache busting on GitHub Raw userscript URLs. Parameters such as `?v=1.2.3` are forbidden because GitHub Raw/CDN caching has repeatedly served stale script bodies even when the query string changed.
- Every README/manual install link for a userscript in this repository must use an immutable `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL pinned to a full 40-character Git commit SHA that contains the exact current script.
- `@downloadURL`, when present, must use the clean mutable `main` raw URL for the full `.user.js` script, with no query parameters and no commit pin.
- `@updateURL` may either use that same clean mutable `.user.js` URL or a dedicated clean mutable `.meta.js` metadata manifest on `main`. A dedicated `.meta.js` manifest is preferred for large userscripts or scripts where update detection reliability is important.
- When a dedicated `.meta.js` manifest is used, its `@name`, `@namespace`, `@version`, `@updateURL`, and `@downloadURL` must stay synchronized with the published userscript.
- Never provide a mutable `main` raw URL as a manual install link when a commit-pinned URL can be provided.

### Identity and version integrity

- Preserve userscript identity across normal updates. Existing `@name` and `@namespace` values must not change.
- Every behavior/code change must increase `@version`.
- A changed userscript must never be committed with the same or a lower `@version` than its previous repository version.
- Versions must move forward monotonically.
- Do not add/remove/change grants, sandboxing, or execution context without checking whether page globals such as `window.MB` remain accessible. Privileged Tampermonkey grants can move a script into a sandbox.

### Required publish order

1. Update the script and increase `@version`.
2. Preserve `@name` and `@namespace`; verify any grant/sandbox changes.
3. Keep `@downloadURL` on the clean `main` raw `.user.js` URL. Keep `@updateURL` on either that URL or the script's dedicated clean `main` raw `.meta.js` manifest.
4. Commit the script.
5. If the script uses a dedicated `.meta.js` manifest, publish/synchronize that manifest to the exact same `@version`.
6. Fetch the immutable commit-pinned raw userscript URL and verify its `@version` and body.
7. Update the README **Install** link to that immutable userscript URL in a separate commit.
8. Verify the userscript metadata, optional `.meta.js` metadata, version, raw source, and README link directly during the publish operation. Do not create or run a GitHub Actions workflow for this validation.
9. Before giving a direct link to the user, compare the known installed version with the target. Only call it **Update** when installed < target.

### Failure handling

- If Tampermonkey shows **Reinstall** and the installed version is lower than the intended target, distribution has failed: stop other work and repair the served source/version.
- If Tampermonkey shows **Reinstall** and installed version equals incoming version, do not reinstall. The user is already current.
- Never tell the user to click **Reinstall** as a workaround for an update problem.
- Userscript publishing must not depend on GitHub Actions. Perform required validation directly as part of the publish operation.



## GitHub Actions policy

This is a blocking repository rule.

- Do **not** create, restore, replace, or enable a GitHub Actions workflow for userscript publishing, userscript distribution, userscript version checks, README install-link checks, cache-busting checks, metadata checks, or routine repository validation.
- Do **not** create or modify any file under `.github/workflows/` unless the user explicitly requests that exact GitHub Actions workflow or explicitly asks to modify an existing workflow.
- Routine software/userscript publishing and updates must be performed by direct repository commits and direct verification, without GitHub Actions.
- Never restore the deleted `.github/workflows/userscript-distribution-check.yml` workflow or an equivalent workflow under another name.
- Existing workflows must remain narrowly path-scoped to the specific tool they were created for. They must not run on `README.md`, `SOFTWARE_RULES.md`, unrelated scripts, or ordinary repository-wide pushes unless the user explicitly requests that behavior.
- A normal userscript update, README update, rule update, or unrelated software update must not trigger GitHub Actions.
- If a validation can be done during the current publish operation, do it directly instead of creating CI.

## Versioned filenames for GitHub software downloads - mandatory

- Every user-downloadable software build, executable, script, installer, or archive must have its **actual version in its physical filename**. GitHub's raw download basename and release asset filename must make the saved file's version immediately obvious.
- **GitHub lexicographic sorting - global requirement (2026-10-14):** For all newly published *versioned downloadable filenames*, zero-pad **each numeric version component to three decimal digits**. Default: `<ProductName> vMMM.mmm.ppp.<extension>` (for example `Music Collection Cleaner v000.005.020.pyw`, `ArchiveMedia v006.000.013.bat`, `SC2 Bridge v000.002.004.pyw`). Use the same padding for release assets and other filename forms with a visible version; if there is a fourth numeric component, pad it too. Numeric fields larger than 999 require a coordinated width migration before publishing, never silent clipping or wraparound. Include the full product name; never substitute generic basenames.
- **Separate file sorting from the software's semantic version.** Filename `v000.005.020` represents exactly software version `0.5.20` numerically. Do not add leading zeros to SemVer tags, executable version resources, Python/JS package versions, user-visible app versions, `APP_VERSION`, `@version`, or dependency/updater comparisons. These continue to use normal version formatting; numerical components must match the padded filename exactly. Never bump a software version solely to pad a filename, and never represent padded filename text as a different software version.
- For every new version, publish a sorting-safe versioned download name, update current-release links/badges/readmes/documented launch commands, and verify the actual GitHub filename and its numeric equivalence to the program version. Repository file-tree listings for a single product with consistently padded version components must sort in numeric version order.
- **Historical migration safety:** Audit existing source files and all direct filename references, self-updaters, packaging scripts, manuals, external download URLs, and releases before renaming old assets. Do not destructively rename, delete, or bulk relocate previously published filenames when that would break existing downloads, installers, pinned references, userscripts, or recovery. Preserve legacy links; where compatibility cannot be maintained, document outstanding historical sorting debt rather than falsely claiming it fixed. Migrate individually after reference updates and verification.
- Stable *internal* source filenames, package metadata and updater endpoints may remain unchanged when renaming would break integrations. In particular preserve Tampermonkey stable `.user.js` install names, `@name`, `@namespace`, `@version`, `@updateURL`, `@downloadURL` and .meta.js manifests. Do **not** create duplicate installable userscripts merely to force sorting; the padded name applies to separately distributed versioned archives/assets only.
- `Under construction ⚠️` remains a separate status, never a version. The repository's **current version and status** must remain accurate. Enforce this lexical-order rule in every existing or newly adopted `karpuzikov` software repository before publishing new versioned artifacts; a nonconforming *new* filename is a release-blocking defect. Do not modify GitHub Actions workflows to implement checks.

## GitHub development status

- The GitHub Version/status column must always show the software's actual current version.
- `Under construction ⚠️` is a status only. It must never replace, hide, or stand in for the version.
- New or updated software must show the actual version together with the status, in the form `<version> - Under construction ⚠️`.
- Keep `Under construction ⚠️` alongside the version until the user confirms testing is complete; then remove only the status and leave the version unchanged.


## ComfyUI prompt optimizer standard - mandatory default

This rule applies to all current and future ComfyUI workflows created or updated for the user when the workflow accepts a natural-language generation/edit prompt. Use this optimizer architecture by default unless the user explicitly asks to omit or replace it.

- Use native ComfyUI `TextGenerate` as the prompt-rewrite engine. Do not require the old PromptEnhancer-MTP node pack when native `TextGenerate` is available.
- Use a dedicated lightweight Qwen3-VL prompt-optimizer encoder: `qwen3vl_8b_int8_convrot.safetensors` from `models/text_encoders/`, loaded as `qwen_image`.
- The prompt optimizer is separate from the model's actual conditioning encoder. Never replace or downgrade the generation model's required text/vision encoder just to run prompt optimization.
- For image-conditioned workflows, feed the original source/reference image(s) into `TextGenerate` so the optimizer can anchor the rewritten prompt to visible content instead of guessing.
- Provide a clearly named `PROMPT OPTIMIZER` boolean control, ON by default.
- When the optimizer is OFF, pass the original user prompt through unchanged and, where ComfyUI lazy execution permits, avoid running the optimizer branch.
- If prompt rewriting returns an empty/failed result, automatically fall back to the original prompt instead of failing the generation.
- Pass relevant workflow state into the optimizer request when it changes prompt semantics, such as audio ON/OFF, generation mode, or reference-image roles.
- Use a model/task-specific system prompt. The optimizer must output only the final model-ready prompt, without commentary, markdown fences, safety prose, or implementation details.
- Preserve exact dialogue, lyrics, captions, signs, and other requested visible/audible text in their original language and wording.
- Keep the user's intent and source identity/content stable. Clarify ambiguous motion/edit instructions, but do not invent unrelated subjects, objects, events, scene changes, or stylistic edits.
- For MiniMax H3 Image-to-Video, the optimized prompt must use exactly these sections: `integrated_multimodal_description`, `overall_soundscape`, and `non_diegetic_music`. Motion should be chronological and physically plausible.
- For MiniMax H3 workflows with audio disabled, the optimizer must set both `overall_soundscape` and `non_diegetic_music` to exactly `none`.
- The existing Qwen Image 2.1 workflow architecture using `TextGenerate` + source image + ON/OFF switch + failure fallback is the canonical implementation pattern to reuse in future workflows.
